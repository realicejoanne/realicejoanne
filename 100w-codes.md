ðŸ’¯Workout-Code Projects is a challenge originally made by me. Feel free to copy the list! There's no specific rules like what programming language or environment to use
but I would like to recommend to upload the projects to be accessible in Github Pages. Use [#100w-codes](https://github.com/topics/100w-codes) to get featured in Github.

2. Calculator (Basic/Scientific)
