ðŸ’¯Workout-UI Designs is a challenge originally made by me. This is an improved version of [Daily UI Design Challenge](https://www.dailyui.co/)
(List can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Pustur/3b2bee790d2c8a966136d76a9157d5e4)). I make this because I feel that challenge is a bit messy.
The point of this challenge is to create your own UI kits. Feel free to copy the list! Use [#100w-ui](https://github.com/topics/100w-ui) to get featured in Behance/Dribbble/anywhere.
